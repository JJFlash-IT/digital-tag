# Chaze in the Maze (Or... Digital Tag)
A FreeBASIC demo where you control an asterisk, the Computer controls a little red face, and both of you are placed in a maze. Oh, and the Computer chases you :smiley:

## Features
- No square roots; only Integers used, no divisions
- Main trick is Walter D. Pullen's Chain Algorithm, from his Daedalus program (see the [Algorithms](https://www.astrolog.org/labyrnth/algrithm.htm#solve) page, and the [Daedalus](https://www.astrolog.org/labyrnth/daedalus.htm) page)
